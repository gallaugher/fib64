# fib64 - A Repository for CircuitPython Animations for the Fibonacci 64 micro by Evil Genius Labs

The files above are CircuitPython programs that will run animations on the beautiful Fibonacci 64 add-on board by Evil Genius Labs. Find out more info about this board at:

Follow @evilgeniuslab and @jasoncoon_ for lots of inspiring builds and demos with these & other boards.

At the time I created this repo, I couldn't find any CircuitPython examples available for the board, so I created some files to use on a tutorial I've posted on my YouTube Channel.

Newbies can find this in the MakerSnacks playlist at:

simple_rainbow_spiral_demo.py is a simple rainbow animation using the neopixel library & the colorwheel function in rainbowio. Rainbow colors fill in the LED arms of the fibonacci board, then the lights fade to black and the animation restarts.

fib64_adafruit_animations.py runs through several animations that are part of the adafruit_led_animation library by Kattni Rembor.

Have any new/interesting animations? Feel free to share & I'll include them here (or link back to your own repo.

@GeekMomProjects has also posted some fun builds using these boards, including a 3D printed battery holder to turn this into a necklace:
